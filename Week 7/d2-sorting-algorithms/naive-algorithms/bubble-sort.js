/*
Bubble Sort is almost NEVER used because it is not efficient!!
- Every movement of an item requires an individual pass through the array.

Bubble Sort works by moving the SMALLEST elements to the beginning of the array.

Bubble Sort manipulates the array by swapping the position of two elements. To
implement Bubble Sort in JS, you'll need to perform this operation. It helps to
have a function to do that. A key detail in this function is that you need an
extra variable to store one of the elements since you will be overwriting them
in the array:Â 
*/

//swap function:
function swap(array, idx1, idx2) {
  let temp = array[idx1]; // save a copy of the first value
  array[idx1] = array[idx2]; // overwrite the first value with the second value
  array[idx2] = temp; // overwrite the second value with the first value
}
//Note that the swap function does not create or return a new array. It mutates
//the original array:
let arr1 = [2, 8, 5, 2, 6];
swap(arr1, 1, 2);
arr1; // => [ 2, 5, 8, 2, 6 ]

//Implementing bubble sort:
function bubbleSort(array) {
  // this variable will be used to track whether or not we
  // made a swap on the previous pass. If we did not make
  // any swap on the previous pass, then the array must
  // already be sorted
  let swapped = true;

  // this while will keep doing passes if a swap was made
  // on the previous pass
  while (swapped) {
    swapped = false; // reset swap to false

    // this for will perform a single pass
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      // if the two value are not ordered...
      if (array[i] > array[i + 1]) {
        // swap the two values
        swap(array, i, i + 1);

        // since you made a swap, remember that you did so
        // b/c we should perform another pass after this one
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
  }

  return array;
