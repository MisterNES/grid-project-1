# AJAX Practice

Note -- this practice assessment is for practicing the FORMAT of the assessment which is new. It is not sufficient AJAX prep and you should focus your study efforts on the Catstagram project.

1. You can run the mocha tests either from the command line using `npm test`
   or opening the **test-page.html**. They run the same tests.
2. Do **NOT** modify the files in the "test" directory. _All_ of your work will
   happen in the numbered files in this directory.

## Usage

1. You have a choice about how you'd like to run these tests:
   * Use **npm test** like normal. You're going to write code using `fetch()`
     and `document` methods like `querySelectorAll`. It might feel weird to be
     doing that _completely not in a browser_. The tests use a virtual DOM and a
     fetch that controls the entire test without a browser. You can just follow
     the instructions and just run **npm test** to do its
     thing.
   * Your second option is to use **test-page.html** in your browser which will load the _exact same
     tests_ and run them in your browser. You'll want to keep your Developer
     Tools open on the Console to see error messages while you're finishing the
     assessment. When you make changes, just refresh the browser and you'll see
     the messages in the browser.
